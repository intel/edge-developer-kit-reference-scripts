# Smart Parking Application

The smart parking application is an AI-based solution to monitor individual car parking spaces and their occupancy statuses in a car park. The model [vehicle-detection-0201](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/intel/vehicle-detection-0201/README.md) from Open Model Zoo is used for car detection in this application.

## Notes
### Model Configuration
You can change the model to pretrained YOLOv8-n by replacing line 37 and 38 in server/utils/video_stream.py with code below:

```
self.detector_yolo = CarDetectorYolo(f'./model/{model_name}_int8_openvino_model/{model_name}.xml', device="CPU")
self.detector_omz = None
```
