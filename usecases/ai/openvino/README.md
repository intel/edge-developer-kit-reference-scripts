## Run Docker Image
### OpenVINO™ Toolkit
1. Run this command to launch docker container with OpenVINO™ image and link to your working directory. For this instance, the working directory is in /home/user/workspace and it mount to container /data/workspace directory.
```bash
docker run -it -d --name openvino_app -v /etc/group:/etc/group --device=/dev/dri --group-add=$(stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -n 1) -v /usr/bin:/usr/bin -v /home/user/workspace:/data/workspace -w /data/workspace openvino/ubuntu22_dev:latest
```

- --name: container name
- -v: mount from local source directory to container destination directory
- --device: Add device to container
- --group-add: Add additional groups
- -w: The default working directory inside the container

2. Run following command to login into container:
```bash
docker exec -it openvino_app /bin/bash
```

3. Now you can run your application with OpenVINO™

### OpenVINO™ Notebooks
1. Run this command to launch OpenVINO™ Notebooks
```bash
docker run -it --name test_notebooks -v /etc/group:/etc/group  --device=/dev/dri --group-add=$(stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -n 1) -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 openvino_notebooks
```
2. Copy the URL printed in the terminal and open in a browser. Example output you will see in terminal:
